### Hi there 👋

Here is Daoping. I am an assistant professor in Risk, Environment and Society at King's College London. I am also an affiliated researcher at the University of Cambridge and the World Economic Forum.

I am intrigued by the exploration of how climate risks impact our human societies and am dedicated to developing strategies for enhancing resilience and adapting to climate change. Collaborating with academics worldwide, I am committed to leveraging cutting-edge artificial intelligence techniques and transdisciplinary knowledge (both science and social science) to develop effective solutions to climate risks. Beyond, I collaborate with the Centre for Climate Engagement at the University of Cambridge and the World Economic Forum to disseminate knowledge on global climate governance to policymakers, stakeholders, and the general public.

Recently, I have been interested in coupled human and natural systems and sustainable systems analysis, including especially: AI and climate risk assessment and governance; climate risk, infrastructures and economic systems; the economics of disasters and risk management; analysis of the cost and benefits of adaptation measures.

I am currently working on the following topics:

- 🌐 Developing new theories of economics from a network perspective
- 🌍 Developing BRIDGE series models that bridge different natural and economic systems
- 🔄 Modeling the propagation of shocks on economic networks
- 🤖 Exploring application of machine learning techniques for climate change risk assessment
- 🏭 Developing methodologies for companies, investors, and insurers to calculate GHG emissions across value chains
- ⚡ Developing methodologies for companies, investors, and insurers to assess the climate-related financial risks
- 🤔 ...
